**Continual Next Activity Prediction with Prompts (CNAPwP)** is an advanced machine learning framework designed to predict the next activity in a sequence of events by leveraging continual learning and prompt-based techniques. CNAPwP continually learns from new data without forgetting previously learned patterns in previous tasks, ensuring accurate and up-to-date predictions. The integration of prompts enhances the model's ability to understand and adapt to various task-specific behaviors, making it a powerful tool for applications in dynamic environments such as user behavior analysis, workflow management, and recommendation systems. 

# The Repository
The repository contains the code for running CNAPwP, including the preprocessing on the datasets, the configurations of each dataset, and the results.
